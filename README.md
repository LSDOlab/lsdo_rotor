# lsdo_rotor

This is a python package for low-fidelity rotor aerodynamic analysis and design. This package includes (differentiable) implementations of blade element momentum (BEM) theory, Pitt--Peters dynamic inflow model (solved for steady state) and a recently developed rotor design method. Please refer to the [project website](https://lsdo-rotor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for more information on installation, usage, theory, and example scripts.
