# Examples

Unlike tutorials, examples can also be generated from Python files (.py) in addition
to Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb),
and is more of a collection of run scripts for reference/benchmarking.
Examples may contain documentation in the form of comments.
However, outputs/visualization from running the script is excluded if you are using Python files.

If no classification of examples is required, just remove the subpages for examples
and add the example files directly into the toctree of this main examples page.
