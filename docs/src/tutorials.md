# Tutorials

These tutorials are generated from Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) and
walks the reader through Python scripts providing detailed
step-by-step instructions.
Each tutorial contains mix of code and text that shows the
functionality of your package.
Tutorials are intended for explaining the fundamental capabilities of the package
and they get progressively more complicated.
It is recommeded that the tutorials also include mathematical equations and outputs/visualization 
from running the script for better understanding for the users.

If no classification of tutorials is required, just remove the subpages for tutorials
and add the tutorial files directly into the toctree of this main tutorials page.
