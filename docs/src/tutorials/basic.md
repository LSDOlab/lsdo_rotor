# Basic tutorials

These pages for each category of tutorials are optional 
and are required only if you plan to classify your tutorials
into different classes such as basic, intermediate, advanced, etc.
or any other classification suitable for your package.
If no classification is required, just remove these pages
and add the tutorial files directly into the toctree of the main
tutorials page.
